This is my reporsitory for my projects while working on My Udacity Data Scientist Nano Degree.

During this project I will be using Python 3.7 as part of an Anaconda Package.

Thank you to Stack Overflow for the help it has provided me with coding questions

PROJECT 1:

    Analysing 2017  Stack Overflow Developer Survey.
    
    Files needed for this project:
        - survey_results_public.csv : This file contains the survey results
        - survey_result_schema.csv  : This file contains the Actual questions associated with the headings of the survey results
    
        One file was generated:
        - countryRegioDic.csv : this file contains the association for each country represented in the survey to a World Region
        
        My Analyses can be found in the jupyter notebook:
        
        JobSatisfactionByWorldRegion.ipynb  
        
        and the main findings can be found [here](https://medium.com/@pirsqred/where-in-the-world-can-you-have-the-most-satisfying-job-4d4f9b066e52)
