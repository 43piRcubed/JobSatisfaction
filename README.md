For this project I will be using Python 3.7 as part of an Anaconda Package.

Thank you to Stack Overflow for the help it has provided me with coding questions

PROJECT:
    
        The motivation for this project was to determine Which region of the world might have the highest job satisfaction for Professional Developer or Professionals with coding experience.
        
        The data used to provide insights on my quest comes from a yearly Stack Overflow survey:
        
        - 2017  Stack Overflow Developer Survey.
    
    Files needed for this project:
    
        - survey_results_public.csv : This file contains the survey results
        - survey_result_schema.csv  : This file contains the Actual questions associated with the headings of the survey results
    
        One file was generated:
        - countryRegioDic.csv : this file contains the association for each country represented in the survey to a World Region
        
        My Analyses can be found in the jupyter notebook:
